## Overview 

This folder contains diverse writing samples including one dating back to high school, when I engaged in more creative and non-scientific writing for a general audience. The introduction of my master's thesis was also written especially for a non-specialist (scientific) audience.

I also started a [personal blog](http://www.masteringheidelberg.wordpress.com) in 2017 when I became explicitly interested in science communication.

...but I opted to keep researching, and my first paper was recently [accepted for publication](https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.42658) in _Arthritis & Rheumatology_.
