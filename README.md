## Welcome!

I'm Morgan, a computational systems biologist by training and a microbiome data journalist by participation. 

There are three folders in this repository organized by content type, each with 3-4 pdfs. Clicking on one will display a README like this containing more information and context.

```           
├── selected-presentations
├── selected-visualizations
└── selected-writings 
```
From there, navigation is possible via the left side bar, or the top menu once a file is clicked. If it takes more than a few seconds to load, please refresh the page.
